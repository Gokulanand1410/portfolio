            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am B Gokul Anand, a passionate and dedicated student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Rajalakshmi Engineering College. I have a keen interest in software development, with a focus on programming languages like Python, Java, and C.

                Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science principles, algorithms, and data structures. I am always eager to learn new technologies and apply them in real-world projects. I have worked on various software development projects, ranging from mobile applications to web development, which have enhanced my problem-solving skills and technical knowledge.
                
                Apart from academics, I actively participate in college events, hackathons, and workshops, as I believe in continuously expanding my knowledge and skill set. My goal is to contribute to the tech world by building impactful software solutions that address real-life problems.
                
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and sharing knowledge with peers. I am always open to learning and growing, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my journey as a budding software engineer.
